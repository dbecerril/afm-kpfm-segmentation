# AFM / KPFM Dual-Image Segmentation with Random Forests

Applied computer vision and data science pipeline for segmenting AFM and KPFM images using **classical machine learning (Random Forests)**, multiscale feature engineering, and statistical analysis.

Developed on **real experimental data**, with a focus on robustness, interpretability, and small-dataset constraints, and a clear roadmap toward deep-learning models (e.g. U-Net).

## Motivation

In experimental and industrial contexts, datasets are often:
- small
- noisy
- heterogeneous

This project prioritizes **reliable, interpretable segmentation** over benchmark-driven deep learning, while still supporting dataset construction for future CNN-based approaches.

## Key Features

- Random Forest segmentation of AFM / KPFM images
- **Dual-image feature fusion** (e.g. topography + phase)
- Multiscale feature extraction (intensity, edges, texture)
- Interactive GUI for labeling and training
- Statistical analysis from segmentation masks
- Publication-quality plots and summaries
